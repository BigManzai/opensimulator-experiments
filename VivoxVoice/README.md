The provided text describes a TCP/IP based voice server implemented in C#. This code replaces the Vivox Server and handles communication between clients over an IP network using asynchronous sockets, threads for handling connections with multiple users.

**Key Features:** 


* **TCPServer class**:  Manages all aspects of running The Voice Sever including establishing listening port on a specified address/port , accepting client connection requests from various devices to the server and managing data flow between clients & Server
<br>



-   The code utilizes delegates (events) for notifying other modules about Client Connection, Disconnection or Data Received. 

* **ServerThread class**: Manages each individual communication with a single connectedClient including reading/writing messages , handling disconnections  and maintaining client state information such as Mute status and name


**Overall:** This implementation provides an efficient voice server that facilitates two-way audio communications between multiple users while ensuring scalability, reliability & security.
